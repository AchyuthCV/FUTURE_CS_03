Secure File Sharing System with AES Encryption - Future Interns Task 3
# Secure File Sharing System - Future Interns Task 3

## 🔐 Project Overview
This project is a **Secure File Sharing System** that allows users to upload and download files safely. Security is the main focus — all files are encrypted using **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** before storage and decrypted during download.  

This project simulates real-world secure data sharing environments, such as **healthcare, legal, or corporate systems**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a web portal using **Python Flask** for file uploads and downloads.  
- Implement **AES encryption** to protect files at rest.  
- Provide a **simple and user-friendly interface** for uploading and retrieving files.  
- Ensure **basic encryption key management** and security best practices.  
- Document the system architecture and security measures.
